# Motivation
Airline delays cost up to 30 billion dollars each year, with increasing losses every year. The delays are caused due to a multitude of reasons, namely, weather, security, and carrier delays. Most  of  these  follow  a  set  pattern,  which  we  aim  to  analyse  and  predict,  and  have  been thoroughly captured in the airline dataset obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. 

# Exploratory Data Analysis
We started out by cleaning and pre-processing the data, to make it fit for further analyses. An exploratory  data  analysis  of  the  structured  dataset  was performed, and  the  patterns  were captured  in  the  form  of  charts/tables.  The  insights  gained  were  helpful  to  pick  the  features necessary  to  feed  into  the  prediction  algorithms.  We  made  use  of  novel  machine  learning models to predict the arrival delay, in the order of minutes. 

# Prediction Phase
The data analysis yielded some important insights into the causes for delays and the solutions that can be used to combat them. The prediction algorithms used were able to predict whether an airline was delayed or not and output a specific delay time with relatively high accuracy. These results can be used to forecast future delays and provides a fine basis for a series of steps an airline could follow to minimise losses. 

# Conclusion
Delay losses could be seriously minimised if airlines put into place a few strategies to dampen the impact of a flight being delayed. Delay propagation and inventory management are a few of the strategies we discuss towards the end. By fully understanding the nature behind these delays, and predicting their happening, measures can be put into place to minimise the damage. We made use of Tableau for the exploratory data analysis, and Python libraries such as Pandas and ScikitLearn, for the pre-processing and predictions respectively.
